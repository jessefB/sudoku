# Overview

This program was built as a learning experience for Python. Having created the same program in C++ earlier, I've built the same program except in Python in order to learn the language.

A Sudoku board is read from a file, then displayed in a "board" format, with characters to help visualize boundaries. The user can then view possible values for a given square, edit the square, and save the board to the original or new file.

This was wholly a learning project - I already had a working Sudoku program written in C++, so this was just an attempt to become more familiar with the Python language.

# Development Environment

This program was written in Python 3.9.1 64-bit using Visual Studio Code as the IDE. Git was used as the version management, and GitHub was used for sharing.

No external libraries were used.
